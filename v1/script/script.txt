🔥 Pechakucha Layout: “Fear of Failure”
Intro (before slide 1 appears)

👤 Presenter 1 (you):
“Good evening! Let me start with a story. 
A toddler is learning to walk, falls down, cries, and then… stands up again. 
Nobody calls it a failure. We call it learning. 
But as we grow older, somehow, we start fearing those very falls.”

👤 Presenter 2:
(smiling) “And today, in just 6 minutes 40 seconds, 
we’re going to talk about fear of failure—something all of us, 
from toddlers to tech leads at Airbus—have faced.”

Engagement: Smile at audience during humor slides. Use eye contact in serious ones.

Humor: Sprinkle but don’t overdo—audience should laugh and then reflect.
